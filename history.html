        <h2>History of Doctor Who</h2>
        <p>
            Doctor Who, Brithish science fiction television series produced by the Brithish Broadcasting Corporation
            (BBC). The show's originals run lasted 26 years, from 1963 to 1989. Remembered for its primitive special
            effects and compelling story lines, <em>Doctor Who</em> became a landmark of British popular culture. The
            series resumed to much acclaim in 2005.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Doctor Who</em> chronicled the adventures of an eccentric time-traveling scientist form the remote
            planet Gallifrey, home of the Time Lords. The Doctor, a Time Lord himself, traveled through time and space
            in his unique craft, the TARDIS, an acronym for Time and Relative Dimensions in Space. Whith an interior
            larger than its exterior, the TARDIS could take on various shapes to blend into its environament.
            Although capable of whisking the Doctor and his passengers to any time and any place in the universe, the
            craft was frequently parked on Earth in the form of a blue police box. Whether in England or in the far
            reaches of space, the Doctor and his colleagues battled a multitude of evils, including robots, monsters,
            and a twisted Time Lord. Certain adversaries recurred throughout the series, notably the Daleks, genocidal
            aliens armoured in robotlike suits who sought the extermination of life-forms inferior to themselves.
        </p>

        <p> The original Doctor was played by William Hartnell until 1966, when the show revealed that Time Lords had
            the ability to regenerate themselves when near death. Their reincarnated forms appeared as different people,
            although they retained the same memories and skills. This plot twist allowed different actors to assume the
            title role. The original series eventually featured seven different Doctors, the longest-lasting of which
            was Tom Baker (1974–81). Over the course of the program, companions of the Doctor included Brigadier
            Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney), a commander in an organization that combats extraterrestrials; Jamie
            McCrimmon (Frazer Hines), an 18th-century Scotsman; and Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen), an
            investigative journalist.
        </p>

        <p> The original series was not so much cancelled as postponed. Following a television movie in 1996, the BBC
            began producing new episodes in 2005, which quickly proved popular. The 10th Doctor, portrayed by David
            Tennant in 2005–10, became a fan favourite, along with such new characters as Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), his
            loyal assistant, and the mysterious River Song (Alex Kingston). In 2017 the show made news with the
            announcement that the 13th Doctor would be portrayed by a woman, Jodie Whittaker; the first episode starring
            Whittaker aired the following year. Doctor Who also engendered numerous spin-offs across different media,
            including the TV series Torchwood (2006–11) and The Sarah Jane Adventures (2007–11).
