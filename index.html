            <h3>Russell T Davies returning as showrunner for 60th, and series beyond</h3>
            <img src="RTD.jpg" alt="RTD" width="300">
            <p>Russell T Davies will make an explosive return to screens to celebrate the 60th Anniversary of Doctor Who
                in 2023, and series beyond. BBC Studios is partnering with Bad Wolf to produce.</p>

            <p>Responsible for Doctor Who’s revival in 2005, Davies is credited with propelling the show into a global
                phenomenon and making it one of TV’s biggest hits.</p>

            <p>His tenure on the show oversaw a surge in popularity, enjoying huge acclaim and success. The Doctor won
                the nation’s hearts through his masterful relaunch, which led him to create two spin-off series,
                Torchwood and The Sarah Jane Adventures, during that time.</p>

            <p>Davies left the show in 2009. A lifelong Doctor Who fan, he has most recently achieved huge success with
                Years And Years, A Very English Scandal and It’s A Sin, which won Best New Drama at the National TV
                Awards this month.</p>

            <p>Russell T Davies says: “I’m beyond excited to be back on my favourite show. But we’re time-travelling
                too fast, there’s a whole series of Jodie Whittaker’s brilliant Doctor for me to enjoy, with my friend
                and hero Chris Chibnall at the helm – I’m still a viewer for now.”</p>

            <h3>New Year's day 2022 special synopsis and guest stars reveled</h3>
            <img src="SpecialNewYear.jpg" alt="RTD" width="300">
            <p> The Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) and friends will kick-start 2022 with an action-packed
                spectacular episode set to air on BBC One on New Year’s Day.</p>

            <p>The festive special will feature guest stars Aisling Bea (This Way Up, Living With Yourself, Quiz),
                Adjani Salmon (Dreaming Whilst Black, Enterprice) and Pauline McLynn (Father Ted, Shameless).</p>

            <p>Sarah (Aisling Bea) owns and runs ELF storage, and Nick (Adjani Salmon) is a customer who visits his
                unit every year on New Year’s Eve. This year, however, their night turns out to be a little different
                than planned.</p>

            <p>The festive episode is the first of three Doctor Who Specials airing in 2022. The second Special airs in
                Spring and Jodie’s final feature-length Special (in where the Thirteenth Doctor will regenerate), will
                transmit in autumn 2022 as part of the BBC’s Centenary celebrations.</p>
