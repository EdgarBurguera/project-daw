            <h2>Every Doctors</h2>
            <h3>Frist Doctor</h3>
            <img src="FristDoctor.jpg" alt="FristDoctor" id="FristDoctor">
            <p>The First Doctor is the original incarnation of the Doctor and the initial protagonist of the BBC science
                fiction television series Doctor Who. He was portrayed by actor William Hartnell.</p>

            <p>Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey
                who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor
                regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes. The concept of
                regeneration, initially referred to as a "renewal," was introduced when Hartnell needed to leave the
                series, and consequently has extended the life of the show for many years.</p>

            <p>Hartnell's portrayal of the character was initially a stubborn and abrasive old man who was distrustful
                of humans, but he mellowed out into a much friendlier, grandfatherly figure who adored his travels with
                his companions. The First Doctor's original companions were his granddaughter Susan (Carole Ann Ford)
                and her schoolteachers Ian Chesterton (William Russell) and Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill). In later
                episodes, he travelled alongside 25th-century orphan Vicki (Maureen O'Brien), space pilot Steven (Peter
                Purves), Trojan handmaiden Katarina (Adrienne Hill), and sixties flower child Dodo Chaplet (Jackie
                Lane). His final on-screen companions were the sailor Ben (Michael Craze) and the posh and sophisticated
                Polly (Anneke Wills). Of the 134 episodes Hartnell appeared in as a regular, 44 are missing.</p>

            <p>Hartnell reprised the role once, in the tenth anniversary story The Three Doctors (1973). The character
                occasionally appeared in the series after Hartnell's death, most prominently in 1983's The Five Doctors
                where he was portrayed by Richard Hurndall, and two episodes in 2017, in a cameo in "The Doctor Falls"
                and in the Christmas special, "Twice Upon a Time", portrayed by David Bradley.</p>

            <h3>Second Doctor</h3>
            <img src="SecondDoctor.jpg" alt="SecondDoctor" id="SecondDoctor">
            <p>The Second Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television
                series Doctor Who. He was portrayed by actor Patrick Troughton. While the Troughton era of Doctor Who is
                well-remembered by fans and in that era's Doctor Who literature, it is difficult to appraise in full; of
                his
                119 episodes, 53 remain missing.</p>

            <p>Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who
                travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor
                regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes. The
                transformation
                into the Second Doctor (originally referred to as a "renewal"), a figure who was the same 'essential'
                character as the first but with a very different persona, was a turning point in the evolution of the
                series, and eventually became a critical element of the series' longevity.</p>

            <p>Troughton's Doctor was an outwardly scruffy, light hearted and bumbling tramp nicknamed the Cosmic Hobo,
                who
                hid a more firm and slightly darker side he would often use to manipulate his enemies and allies alike
                for
                the greater good. His original "swinging sixties" companions were the sophisticated socialite Polly
                (Anneke
                Wills) and working class sailor Ben Jackson (Michael Craze), who travelled with his previous
                incarnation.
                They were later joined by 18th century laird Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines), who would become the Second
                Doctor's most loyal and trusted companion. Following Ben and Polly's departures, the Doctor and Jamie
                were
                joined by the Victorian orphan Victoria Waterfield (Deborah Watling) and 21st century astrophysicist Zoe
                Heriot (Wendy Padbury). Jamie and Zoe stayed with the Second Doctor until the Time Lords sent them back
                to
                their own times, with their memories of all but their first encounter with him wiped.</p>

            <h3>Third Doctor</h3>
            <img src="ThirdthDoctor.jpg" alt="ThirdDoctor" id="ThirdDoctor">
            <p>The Third Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television
                series Doctor Who. He was portrayed by actor Jon Pertwee. Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a
                centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in the TARDIS,
                frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor regenerates. Consequently, both the physical
                appearance and personality of the Doctor changes.</p>

            <p>Pertwee portrays the Third Doctor as a dapper man of action in stark contrast to his wily but less
                action-orientated predecessors. While previous Doctors' stories had all involved time and space travel,
                for
                production reasons Pertwee's stories initially depicted the Doctor stranded on Earth in exile, where he
                worked as a scientific advisor to the international military group UNIT. Within the story, the Third
                Doctor
                came into existence as part of a punishment from his own race, the Time Lords, who forced him to
                regenerate
                and also disabled his TARDIS. Eventually, this restriction is lifted and the Third Doctor embarks on
                more
                traditional time travel and space exploration stories.</p>

            <p>His initial companion is UNIT scientist Liz Shaw (Caroline John), who unceremoniously leaves the Doctor's
                company between episodes to be replaced by the more wide-eyed Jo Grant (Katy Manning), who then
                continues to
                accompany the Doctor after he regains use of his TARDIS. His final companion is intrepid journalist
                Sarah
                Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen).</p>

            <h3>Foruth Doctor</h3>
            <img src="FourthDoctor.jpg" alt="ForuthDoctor" id="FourthDoctor">
            <p>
                The Fourth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television
                series Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Tom Baker.
            </p>
            <p>
                Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey
                who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor
                regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Baker portrays the Fourth Doctor as a whimsical and sometimes brooding individual whose enormous
                personal warmth is at times tempered by his capacity for righteous anger. His initial companions were
                intrepid journalist Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen), who had travelled alongside his previous
                incarnation, and Surgeon-Lieutenant Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter) of UNIT. His later companions were
                savage warrior Leela (Louise Jameson), robotic dog K9, Time Lady Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), teen
                genius Adric (Matthew Waterhouse), alien teenage aristocrat Nyssa (Sarah Sutton), and Australian flight
                attendant Tegan (Janet Fielding).
            </p>
            <p>
                Baker portrayed the character for seven consecutive seasons, which remains the longest tenure of any
                actor to portray the lead, counting both the classic and modern series. He is considered to be one of
                the most recognisable and iconic incarnations of the Doctor both in the United Kingdom and
                internationally.

            <h3>Fifth Doctor</h3>
            <img src="FifthDoctor.jpg" alt="FifthDoctor" id="FifthDoctor">
            <p>The Fifth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television
                series Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Peter Davison.
            </p>

            <p>Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey
                who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor
                regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes.
            </p>

            <p>Davison portrays the Fifth Doctor as having a vulnerable side and a tendency towards indecisiveness,
                dressed as a boyish Edwardian cricketer. He travelled with a host of companions, including boy genius
                Adric (Matthew Waterhouse), alien aristocrat Nyssa (Sarah Sutton) and Australian flight attendant Tegan
                Jovanka (Janet Fielding), whom he had travelled alongside in his previous incarnation. He also shared
                later adventures alongside devious schoolboy Vislor Turlough (Mark Strickson) and American college
                student Peri Brown (Nicola Bryant).

            <h3>Sixth Doctor</h3>
            <img src="SixthDoctor.jpg" alt="SixthDoctor" id="SixthDoctor">
            <p>The Sixth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television
                series Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Colin Baker. Although his televisual time on the series was
                comparatively brief and turbulent, Baker has continued as the Sixth Doctor in Big Finish's range of
                original Doctor Who audio adventures. Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien
                Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with
                companions. At the end of life, the Doctor regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and
                personality of the Doctor changes. Baker portrays the sixth such incarnation, an arrogant, flamboyant
                character in brightly coloured, mismatched clothes whose brash, often patronising personality set him
                apart from all his previous incarnations.
            </p>

            <p>The Sixth Doctor appeared in three seasons. His appearance in the first of these was at the end of the
                final episode of The Caves of Androzani which featured the regeneration from the Fifth Doctor and
                thereafter in the following serial The Twin Dilemma, the end of that season. The Sixth Doctor's era was
                marked by the decision of the BBC controller Michael Grade to put the series on an 18-month "hiatus"
                between seasons 22 and 23, with only one new Doctor Who story, Slipback, made on radio during the
                hiatus, broadcast as 6 parts (at 10 minutes each) on BBC Radio 4 from 25 July to 8 August 1985, as part
                of a children's magazine show called Pirate Radio Four. Colin Baker had been signed up for four
                years, as the previous actor Peter Davison had left after only three years. Due to his decidedly
                short screen time, the Sixth Doctor appeared with only two companions, most notably the American college
                student Peri Brown (Nicola Bryant), before being briefly joined by Mel Bush (Bonnie Langford), a
                computer technician from his future he had yet to actually meet during his trial.
            </p>

            <p>Prior to its postponement, season 23 was well advanced with episodes already drafted and in at least one
                case distributed to cast and production. Alongside "The Nightmare Fair", "The Ultimate Evil", "Mission
                to Magnus", "Yellow Fever and How to Cure It", the remaining stories were still under development in a
                25-minute episode format after the season was postponed. These were all dropped with the reconception of
                the season in mid 1985 in favour of the 14-episode story arc The Trial of a Time Lord. The Sixth
                Doctor also appeared in the special Dimensions in Time. There are also novels and audio plays featuring
                the Sixth Doctor, and the character has been visually referenced several times in the revived 2000s
                production of the show.
            </p>

            <p>More so than any other canonical incarnation, aside from the Eighth Doctor, the Sixth Doctor has been
                heavily expanded upon in expanded universe media, most notably in audio stories produced by Big Finish
                Productions. In The Marian Conspiracy (2000), a new companion was introduced - Dr. Evelyn Smythe, a
                middle-aged history lecturer on the verge of compulsory retirement whose sharp tongue and unwillingness
                to tolerate the Doctor's attitude steadily taught him to rein in his more unkind tendencies. Due to this
                influence, the Sixth Doctor evolved into a more compassionate and likable character. In addition,
                beginning with the webcast Real Time (2003), his costume was revised into a monochromatic blue variant,
                displayed on many audio stories' covers since then.

            <h3>Seventh Doctor</h3>
            <img src="SeventhDoctor.jpg" alt="SeventhDoctor" id="SeventhDoctor">
            <p>The Seventh Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television
                series Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Scottish actor Sylvester McCoy.
            </p>

            <p>Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey
                who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor
                regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes.
            </p>

            <p>McCoy portrays the Seventh Doctor as a whimsical, thoughtful character who quickly becomes more layered,
                secretive, and manipulative. His first companion was Melanie Bush (Bonnie Langford), a computer
                programmer who travelled with his previous incarnation, and who is soon succeeded by troubled teenager
                and explosives expert Ace (Sophie Aldred), who becomes his protégée.
            </p>

            <p>The Seventh Doctor first appeared on TV in 1987. After the programme was cancelled at the end of 1989,
                the Seventh Doctor's adventures continued in novels until the late 1990s. The Seventh Doctor made an
                appearance at the start of the 1996 movie before the character was replaced by the Eighth Doctor (Paul
                McGann).

            <h3>Eighth Doctor</h3>
            <img src="EighthDoctor.jpg" alt="EighthDoctor" id="EighthDoctor">

            <p>The Eighth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television
                series Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Paul McGann.
            </p>

            <p>The character was introduced in the 1996 TV film Doctor Who, a back-door pilot produced in an
                unsuccessful attempt to relaunch the series following its 1989 cancellation. While the Eighth Doctor
                initially had only one on-screen appearance, his adventures were portrayed extensively in subsequent
                spin-off media, including more than 70 audio dramas starring McGann. In 2013, the actor reprised the
                role in the mini-episode "The Night of the Doctor", which depicts the Eighth Doctor's final adventure
                and his regeneration into the War Doctor (played by John Hurt).
            </p>

            <p>Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey
                who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor
                regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes.
            </p>

            <p>McGann portrays the eighth such incarnation, a passionate, enthusiastic, and eccentric character. His
                only companion in the television film is Grace Holloway (Daphne Ashbrook), a medical doctor whose
                surgery is partly responsible for triggering his regeneration. In the continued adventures of the
                character depicted in audio dramas, novels and comic books he travels alongside numerous other
                companions, including self-styled "Edwardian Adventuress" Charley, the alien Destrii and present-day
                humans Lucie and Sam.

            <h3>War Doctor</h3>
            <img src="WarDoctor.jpg" alt="WarDoctor" id="WarDoctor">

            <p>The War Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction
                television programme Doctor Who. He was portrayed by the English actor John Hurt. Although he
                precedes Christopher Eccleston's Ninth Doctor in the show's fictional chronology, his first onscreen
                appearance came eight years after Eccleston's; the War Doctor was retroactively created by showrunner
                Steven Moffat for productions celebrating the show's 50th anniversary.
            </p>

            <p>Within the programme's narrative, the Doctor is an alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, who is
                hundreds if not thousands of years old and travels in time and space in his TARDIS, frequently with
                companions. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body, but in doing so, gains a
                new physical appearance and with it, a distinct new personality. This plot device has allowed a number
                of actors to portray different incarnations of the Doctor over the show's long run.
            </p>

            <p>The War Doctor, not so named within the episodes in which he appears, is introduced as the incarnation
                of the Doctor who fought in the Time War of the show's modern-day backstory. He was created as a result
                of a conscious decision of the Eighth Doctor, played by Paul McGann, to take up arms and become a
                warrior; in accepting this duty, the War Doctor disowned the title of "Doctor", and after the war's end
                is viewed with disdain by his subsequent incarnations, who reclaim the title that the character is known
                by. In the 50th anniversary special "The Day of the Doctor", however, the Eleventh Doctor played by Matt
                Smith revises his opinion of this incarnation after revisiting the final moments of the war.
            </p>

            <p>In his original conception of the show's anniversary special, Moffat had written the Ninth Doctor as
                having ended the Time War. However, he was "pretty certain" that Christopher Eccleston would decline to
                return to the role, which he did. As he also had reservations about making Paul McGann's Eighth Doctor
                the incarnation who had ended the war, he created a never-before-seen past incarnation of the Doctor,
                which allowed him "a freer hand" in writing the story, acknowledging that the success of doing this
                would be predicated on being able to cast an actor with a significant enough profile.

            <h3>Ninth Doctor</h3>
            <img src="NinthDoctor.jpg" alt="NinthDoctor" id="NinthDoctor">

            <p>The Ninth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television
                programme Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Christopher Eccleston during the first series of the show's
                revival in 2005. Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the
                planet Gallifrey who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of
                life, the Doctor regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor
                changes. Eccleston's Doctor was a war-torn loner who disguises his trauma brought on by the Time War
                using a sense of humour and determination to protect the innocent. The production team's approach to the
                character and Eccleston's portrayal were highlighted as being intentionally different from his
                predecessors, with Eccleston portraying the character as being less eccentric.
            </p>

            <p>To fit in with a 21st-century audience, the Doctor was given a primary companion, Rose Tyler, played by
                Billie Piper, who was designed to be as independent and courageous as himself. He also briefly travels
                with Adam Mitchell (Bruno Langley), a self-serving boy genius who acts as a foil to the companions but
                ultimately proves unworthy, and Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman), a reformed con man from the 51st
                century. The Doctor, Rose and Jack form a close team but are separated in the series finale in which
                each character has to make difficult choices and face sacrifice.
            </p>

            <p>In 2006, readers of Doctor Who Magazine voted Eccleston's Doctor the third most popular Doctor. Both
                mainstream press and science fiction reviewers generally credit Eccleston and his incarnation of the
                character as helping to re-establish the show following its hiatus between 1996 and 2005. The
                character's interactions with his arch-enemies, the Daleks, were particularly praised. Eccleston won
                several awards for his single series including the 2005 National Television Award for Best Actor.

            <h3>Tenth Doctor</h3>
            <img src="TenthDoctor.jpg" alt="TenthDoctor" id="TenthDoctor">

            <p>The Tenth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television
                programme Doctor Who. He is played by David Tennant in three series as well as nine specials. As with
                previous incarnations of the Doctor, the character has also appeared in other Doctor Who spin-offs.
                Tennant's time as the Tenth Doctor is still very popular among fans of the show and is generally
                regarded as one of the most iconic incarnations of the character, often ranked alongside Tom Baker's
                Fourth Doctor.
            </p>

            <p>Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey
                who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor
                regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes. Tennant's
                portrayal of the Doctor is of an outwardly charismatic and charming adventurer whose likable and
                easygoing attitude can quickly turn to righteous fury when provoked.</p>

            <p>This incarnation's companions include working class shop assistant Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), medical
                student Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and fiery temp worker Donna Noble (Catherine Tate). He eventually
                parts ways with them all by the end of the 2008 series finale, "Journey's End", after which he attempts
                to travel alone for the duration of the 2008–2010 specials before being accompanied by Donna's
                grandfather Wilfred Mott (Bernard Cribbins) on his final adventure in "The End of Time".

            <h3>Eleventh Doctor</h3>
            <img src="EleventhDoctor.jpg" alt="EleventhDoctor" id="EleventhDoctor">

            <p>The Eleventh Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction
                television programme Doctor Who. He is played by Matt Smith in three series as well as five specials. As
                with previous incarnations of the Doctor, the character has also appeared in other Doctor Who spin-offs.
                Smith's portrayal of the Eleventh Doctor has been critically acclaimed by critics and fans of the show.
            </p>

            <p>Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a centuries-old alien Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey
                who travels in time and space in the TARDIS, frequently with companions. At the end of life, the Doctor
                regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes. Smith's
                incarnation is a quick-tempered but compassionate character whose youthful appearance is at odds with
                his more discerning and world-weary temperament.
            </p>

            <p>This incarnation's main companions included feisty Scot Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), her husband Rory
                Williams (Arthur Darvill) and the mysterious Clara Oswald (Jenna-Louise Coleman). He also frequently
                appeared alongside River Song (Alex Kingston), a fellow time traveller with whom he shared a romantic
                storyline, and he was the last Doctor to appear alongside the long-serving companion Sarah Jane Smith
                (Elisabeth Sladen) prior to the actress' death, featuring in two episodes of the spin-off programme The
                Sarah Jane Adventures.

            <p>The Twelfth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the BBC science fiction television
                programme Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Scottish actor Peter Capaldi. As with previous incarnations of

                regenerates; as a result, the physical appearance and personality of the Doctor changes. Capaldi's
                portrayal of the Doctor is a spiky, brusque, contemplative, and pragmatic character who conceals his
                emotions in the course of making tough and sometimes ruthless decisions.
            </p>

            <p>This incarnation's companions include school teacher Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman), canteen assistant and
